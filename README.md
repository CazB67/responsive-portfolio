# Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio

## Description
This is an assignment to show learning of Bootstrap and an understanding of media responsiveness (the ability of a web application to render well on a variety of devices and windows or screen sizes). A functional responsive portfolio was created using the Bootstrap CSS Framework. This portfolio provides an opportunity to showcase developing skills, knowledge and understanding. This project has taught me how to use bootstrap as well as brought a deeper understanding of various code elements. It features the required items of
* A navbar 
* A responsive layout
* Responsive images
* Minimal use of media queries.

## Installation
The pages `index.html`, `portfolio.html` and `contact.html` were created in VSCode. Existing portfolio sites were looked at for ideas and the sample portfolio images were broken down into their parts and plans drawn up. The common elements to all three pages were created. These include navbar, footer and body background. Specific bootstrap responsive code was used to create the body of the three pages. Finally pages were checked for responsiveness on different devices using the inspect tool. Bootstrap, HTML, CSS and Git were used to create the pages.
